Wrush - Wordpress Command Line
=====

Welcome on, i think, to the first CLI dedicated to Wordpress.
This CLI will helps you to have some informations of your Wordpress site without open your browser.

Why ?
=====

I work in systems administration so I looked for a solution to launch cron task and to see some informations 
about our company wordpress.
So i took a weekend to develop this.

Wrush, strange name isn't it ?
=====

Yes ! But it's a wink to Drush which is usefully awesome to use with Drupal instances.

Your code is poor man !
=====

God bless my skill's, i'm not developper so ... i did with what i know !
We are on Github so if you think you can contribute, don't hesitate ;-)
